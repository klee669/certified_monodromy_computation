# CertifiedMonodromyComputation.jl

**CertifiedMonodromyComputation.jl** is a Julia package for **certified numerical homotopy tracking** and **monodromy group computation**. It uses interval arithmetic (via [Nemo.jl](https://github.com/Nemocas/Nemo.jl) and Arb) to provide mathematically rigorous results and integrates with [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) for group-theoretic analysis.

## Features

* **Certified Tracking:** Uses interval arithmetic and the Krawczyk test to certify solution paths.
* **Automated Monodromy:** Automatically tracks the complete graph to generate the monodromy group (`solve_monodromy`).
* **GAP Integration:** Seamless conversion of tracking data into GAP permutation groups for high-level analysis (e.g., Galois Width).
